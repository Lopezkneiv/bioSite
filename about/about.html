                <h2>My Friend: Nicole Bowar</h2>
                <p>Nicole Bowar is one of my closest friends. She has lived in Minnesota for her entire life, but loves to travel anywhere and everywhere, whenever possible. She attended the University of Minnesota - Duluth, studying environmental science, but left before completing her degree.</p>
                <p>She instead came back home and started working on other skills. She did complete an Associate's Degree and worked her way into management level positions in her work places. Currently, she is working at a bank and helping her community reach their financial goals.</p>
                <p>Her best friend is our cat, Paul. She's had Paul for the last several years and says he is the sweetest cat she's ever had. Paul enjoys lounging in the sun and getting brushes. He also loves to cuddle and invade everyone/anyones' personal space. </p>
                <p>Nicole currently has a trip planned to Greece, which she'll go on next June. She says she's incredibly excited for it, as she's never left the country before.</p>
